# TODO:
## Performance
- Disconnecting clients is relatively slow. 
- Vision command is heavily optimizable
- Do not start before using a profiler first
- We'll do it when everything else is working

[^1]: A variant if you stop the server with a lower amount of players on it is, it will only listen to *one* player and ignore others, *despite them connecting successfully*
